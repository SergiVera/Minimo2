Implementing an app that has two layouts. In the first one the user enters a username of the someone GitHub profile and can explore his followers. When the user taps the button a new layout will be open where the user will see some information, such as followers, number of repos and following people.

For this app we use Retrofit and OkHttp libraries. To show the profile images we use Picasso, third party library.
